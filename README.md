## Building 100 JavaScript Projects 

- I will be building 100 JavaScript projects & I will be building atleast a project a day to meet my goals.
- I am currently a JavaScript beginner barely done with fundamentals so I am building
these projects for other beginners as myself that would like to figure out if what they have covered so far is really sticking as I haven't seen as many resources encouraging beginners to get their hands dirty as this one.
- In case I build a project following a tutorial, I will link to the tutorial underneath the project so you can check out it for yourself.
-For these projects, styles will be updated internally as the main focus will be on JavaScript unless otherwise as the projects get bigger.
-Lastly, future contributors to these projects are highly appreciated for taking a chunk of their scarce and precious time to help out the newbies. I know not everyone can sacrifice the way
you have and for that, myself and the newbie who will be doing these projects are entirely
grateful.

- You can change the background color of the body when you click on the button
- This is a project to help build your confidence on variables, events and functions.
-I was inspired by a similar project on [JS Beginners](https://jsbeginners.com/change-background-color-project/). You can check it out for more inspiration and steps 
on how to build a similar project.
-I also used [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14323082/why-doesnt-backgroundcolor-rgba-b-c-work) to learn more on how to use rgb values in JavaScript
