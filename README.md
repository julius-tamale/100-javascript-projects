## Building 100 JavaScript Projects 

- I will be building 100 JavaScript projects & I will be building atleast a project a day to meet my goals.
- I am currently a JavaScript beginner barely done with fundamentals so I am building
these projects for other beginners as myself that would like to figure out if what they have covered so far is really sticking as I haven't seen as many resources encouraging beginners to get their hands dirty as this one.
- In case I build a project following a tutorial, I will link to the tutorial underneath the project so you can check out it for yourself.
-For these projects, styles will be updated internally as the main focus will be on JavaScript unless otherwise as the projects get bigger.
-Lastly, future contributors to these projects are highly appreciated for taking a chunk of their scarce and precious time to help out the newbies. I know not everyone can sacrifice the way
you have and for that, myself and the newbie who will be doing these projects are entirely
grateful.
