## Building 100 JavaScript Projects 

- I will be building 100 JavaScript projects. 
- I will be building a project a day to meet my goals.
- I am a JavaScript beginner barely done with fundamentals so I am building
these projects as I haven't seen as many resources encouraging beginners to get 
their hands dirty as this one.
- In case I will be following a tutorial to build a project, I will link to the tutorial
underneat the project heading so you can check out it for yourself.
-For these projects, styles will be updated internaly as the main focus will be on JavaScript unless otherwise I will be updating under each project sub-heading.
-Future contributors to these projects are highly appreciated for taking a chunk of their 
scarce and precious time to help out the newbies. I know not everyone can sacrifice the way
you have and for that, myself and the newbie who will be doing these projects are entirely
grateful.
